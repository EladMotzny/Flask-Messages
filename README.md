# Flask-Messages

This is a simple messaging api made using Flask in Python.


This program has the functionality to:

- Write message to someone
- Get all messages for a user
- Get all unread messages for a user
- Read a message
- Delete a message

The app is deployed on Heroku in:
 https://flask-message-api.herokuapp.com/

I have also added a postman requests file for examples on how to use this API. See the file: 
```
Messages API.postman_collection.json
```

If you want to test it locally, please run:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python app.py
```
